\f0\fs24 \cf0 Animation task in iOS\
\
The animation file (animation.swf) is on desktop.\
\
1) When a button with any image is pressed, it should show a view with  circle, star and trash 	buttons.\
\
2) When Star is pressed, the star should move to starting position of view and the view of menu 	should increase and 	should show additional fields.\
\
3) BONUS :  Dim the background elements when first button with image is pressed. And also move 	the button to starting position on the screen.\
\
You can use any method to use animation.\
\

\b \ul Important:
\b0 \ulnone  Make frequent commits in github. Store the files in ios-test folder on desktop and make frequent commits in GitHub. I have already created repository on git and you just have to make commits in the gitHub app. I would like to view how the code is evolved.\
 \
